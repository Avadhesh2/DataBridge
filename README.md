# DataBridge: Spring Boot REST API Project

## Overview
DataBridge is a Spring Boot REST API that utilizes Spring Data JPA and MySQL database. The application demonstrates how to create a RESTful API from scratch, handling CRUD operations and managing database interactions effectively.

## Features
- **RESTful API**: Built using Spring Boot, providing endpoints for managing course details.
- **Data Persistence**: Uses Spring Data JPA for database interactions.
- **Database**: Configured with MySQL, with the ability to create tables dynamically.
- **Testing**: API can be tested using Postman.

## Tech Stack
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building Java-based applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access with JPA.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing data.
- **Postman**: Tool for testing APIs.

## Project Structure
- `src/main/java`: Contains the Java source files.
  - `controller`: Contains REST controllers.
  - `service`: Contains service classes with business logic.
  - `repository`: Contains JPA repository interfaces for database operations.
  - `model`: Contains entity classes mapped to database tables.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains configuration files.
  - `application.yml`: Configuration for the MySQL database.
- `pom.xml`: Maven dependencies configuration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- JDK 11 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL Database

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Avadhesh2/DataBridge.git


   
Navigate to the project directory:

cd DataBridge
Update the MySQL database configuration:

Open src/main/resources/application.yml and set your database credentials:
yaml

spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
    username: your_username
    password: your_password
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    show-sql: true

    
Build the project:

mvn clean install


Run the application:

mvn spring-boot:run
API Endpoints
Create or Update Course
POST /courses
Get Course by ID
GET /courses/{id}
Get All Courses
GET /courses
Delete Course by ID
DELETE /courses/{id}
Testing with Postman
Use Postman to send requests to the API endpoints for testing. Ensure that the application is running before testing.
